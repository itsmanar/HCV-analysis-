# HCV-analysis-

"Chronic hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality and predisposes to liver fibrosis, the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. The staging of liver fibrosis is critical for the management and prognosis of patients. This review provides an update on hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology, summarizes basic mechanisms of HCV-dependent liver fibrogenesis, and discusses common methods for assessment of liver fibrosis. While liver biopsy was until recently considered as the gold standard, novel non-invasive methods, including serum biomarkers, transient elastography and combination algorithms, are gradually being incorporated into new guidelines and are becoming standard of care."
